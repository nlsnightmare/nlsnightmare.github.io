<p>Well, assuming you didn’t visit this page by accident, you’re here to 
learn a bit about me. If you’re looking for a tl;dr, <a href="#too-long-didnt-read">well here you go</a></p>

<h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<p>I was born in Athens, in 1996. I always loved playing games, and from
a very early age I was making <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Powerpoint Presentations</code> which I pretended 
was games (as a sidenote, if you also did this, I love you).</p>

<p>One day, my father was on the computer. He wasn’t a programmer, however
he knew a bit of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Visual Basic</code>, and he liked to make small programs, which
would typically be showcases of historical events. I showed a lot of 
interest, so he decided to teach me the few things he knew. 
The first time I actually got to write some code, I loved it. After that
I started maniacally searching the internet for tutorials, so I could 
learn more. Well, I was about 12 at the time. Needless to say, programming
has become both my hobby and my job. I have yet to regret it ;)</p>

<h2 id="ok-something-more-recent">Ok, something more recent?</h2>
<p>Right now, I’m the lead developer in a Greek tech company. I do mainly 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Backend</code> stuff, but I also dabble in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Frontend</code>, as well as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DevOps</code>.
Our tech stack mainly consists of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Angular</code> on the frontend, and either
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expressjs</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Laravel</code> on the backend. We also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker</code> and 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kubernetes</code> for our deployment.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking that’s a lot of buzzwords, well you’re not really
wrong, but hey, if it works don’t fix it, am I right?</p>

<h2 id="talk-is-cheap-show-me-code">Talk is cheap, show me code</h2>
<p>Well, as you can probably see, this blog is quite new. I haven’t made
any posts about my personal projects yet, although you could say this
is a personal project ;)<br />
In any case, you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/nlsnightmare">github</a>.
The code there isn’t the best example of my work, but it should at least
give you an idea of what kind of projects I like to work on. I also plan
to soon™ begin a series of blog posts on my personal projects. Stay 
tuned!</p>

<h2 id="too-long-didnt-read">Too Long; Didn’t Read</h2>
<p>A life-long programmer, who started coding at the age of 12. I am currently
working as a full-stack developer. Uh… yeah, that’s all folks! Thanks for
reading!</p>
