# About me
<hr class="mb-2 border-gray-400">

Well, assuming you didn't visit this page by accident, you're here to 
learn a bit about me. If you're looking for a tl;dr, [well here you go.](#too-long-didnt-read)

## Beginnings
I was born in Athens, in 1996. I always loved playing games, and from
a very early age I was making `Powerpoint Presentations` which I pretended 
was games (as a sidenote, if you also did this, I love you).

One day, my father was on the computer. He wasn't a programmer, however
he knew a bit of `Visual Basic`, and he liked to make small programs, which
would typically be showcases of historical events. I showed a lot of 
interest, so he decided to teach me the few things he knew. 
The first time I actually got to write some code, I loved it. After that
I started maniacally searching the internet for tutorials, so I could 
learn more. Well, I was about 12 at the time. Needless to say, programming
has become both my hobby and my job. I have yet to regret it ;)

## Ok, something more recent?
Right now, I'm the lead developer in a Greek tech company. I do mainly 
`Backend` stuff, but I also dabble in `Frontend`, as well as `DevOps`.
Our tech stack mainly consists of `Angular` on the frontend, and either
`Expressjs` or `Laravel` on the backend. We also use `Docker` and 
`Kubernetes` for our deployment.

If you're thinking that's a lot of buzzwords, well you're not really
wrong, but hey, if it works don't fix it, am I right?

## Talk is cheap, show me code
Well, as you can probably see, this blog is quite new. I haven't made
any posts about my personal projects yet, although you could say this
is a personal project ;)  
In any case, you can check out my [github.]({{ site.data.contact.github }})
The code there isn't the best example of my work, but it should at least
give you an idea of what kind of projects I like to work on. I also plan
to soon&trade; begin a series of blog posts on my personal projects. Stay 
tuned!

## Too Long; Didn't Read
A life-long programmer, who started coding at the age of 12. I am currently
working as a full-stack developer. Uh... yeah, that's all folks! Thanks for
reading!
